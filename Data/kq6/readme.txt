Left torr seal of tuning fork to harden for 2 hours. Then applied silver epoxy for tip and contacts and left to sit for 12 hours overnight. Baked at 60 for 2 hours after. And immediately tested. Silver Epoxy probably did not fully dry yet.

Put glue at the bottom leg and the 2 stubs at the base of the tuning fork. Attempted to leave the area joining the base and legs free.
